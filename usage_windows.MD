4. **Use the Tool:**
Once the file is open in your browser, you will see the "Abstract Cleaner" interface. Paste the abstract or text you want to clean, click "Fix," and review the cleaned text. You can copy the cleaned output using the button provided.
5. **Editing the File (Optional):**
If you want to edit the script, you can open the `.html` file with a text editor like Notepad, Notepad++, or Visual Studio Code. After making changes, save it and reopen in the browser to see your changes.

### Important Notes

- The script works offline and does not require an internet connection.
- Always check the cleaned text against the original PDF to ensure paragraph structure and formatting are preserved.
- If you encounter issues, make sure the file is saved with the `.html` extension and is not opened in a text editor by default (Windows may sometimes open `.html` files in Notepad instead of the browser).

This method is standard for running HTML-based tools on Windows and is supported by all major browsers.
