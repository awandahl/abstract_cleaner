### How to Run the Script Locally on Mac

1. **Download the File:**
Save the file `abstract_cleaner.html` to a folder on your Mac (for example, on your Desktop or in a folder you create).
2. **Locate the File:**
Open Finder and navigate to the folder where you saved the file.
3. **Open the File in a Browser:**
    - Double-click the file `abstract_cleaner.html`.
        - This will open it in your default web browser (such as Safari, Chrome, or Firefox).
    - Alternatively, right-click (or Control-click) the file, select "Open With," and choose your preferred browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).
4. **Use the Tool:**
Once the file is open in your browser, you will see the "Abstract Cleaner" interface. Paste the abstract or text you want to clean, click "Fix," and review the cleaned text. You can copy the cleaned output using the button provided.
5. **Editing the File (Optional):**
If you want to edit the script, you can open the `.html` file with a text editor like TextEdit, BBEdit, or Visual Studio Code. After making changes, save it and reopen in the browser to see your changes.

### Important Notes

- The script works offline and does not require an internet connection.
- Always check the cleaned text against the original PDF to ensure paragraph structure and formatting are preserved.
- If the file opens in a text editor instead of a browser, right-click the file, select "Open With," and choose your preferred browser. You can also set the browser as the default application for HTML files in the file's "Get Info" panel.

This method is standard for running HTML-based tools on Mac and is supported by all major browsers.
